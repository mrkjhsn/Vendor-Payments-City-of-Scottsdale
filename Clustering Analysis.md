## Clustering Analysis - Do some vendors receive payments at specific times of the year?
###   I found the average payment date for each vendor, then the absolute difference from that date for each payment.  Finally, I aggregated these amounts for each vendor and divided by the total number of payments to the vendor.  This provided me with a means to score each vendor.  The smaller the score produced by the above process, the more likely that the vendors payments would be more tightly clustered.

### In contrast to the above analysis, do some vendors receive payments at more dispersed intervals throughout the year?  To find this, I sorted by the score I created to perform the above analysis, identifying the vendors with the highest score.
